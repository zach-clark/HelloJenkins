#gcc -o hellomake hellomake.c hellofunc.c -I.
echo Hello!!! I\'m a shell script!!!
echo I can even make a new branch, and in theory, this should also \"build\", aka, run this script. Yippee!
echo This build will fail... Silly computer doesn\'t have gcc...
echo Maybe if I put make at the end of the file???
make
