#gcc -o hellomake hellomake.c hellofunc.c -I.
echo Hello!!! I\'m a shell script!!!
echo I can even make a new branch, and in theory, this should also \"build\", aka, run this script. Yippee!
echo This build will fail... Silly computer doesn\'t have gcc...

echo I\'m putting in this change to see if Jenkins will send an email if I put capital letters in my email, since it wasn\'t working with lowercase letters
echo Alright, here\'s attempt two at actually getting emails.
#make
